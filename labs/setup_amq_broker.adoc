= Deploy and setup AMQ Broker

== Introduction 

The tracking of product purchases and the raising of restock requirements is done through messages sent to 
and consumed from a message broker, implemented using Red Hat AMQ Broker. In this section we will use the 
AMQ Broker Operator to setup a broker instance and configure the message addresses needed to establish the 
communication backbone of our system.

== Note

The following YAML snippets require you to replace the namespace value with the name of the OpenShift
project you are currently using.


== Install the AMQ Broker Operator

Find the AMQ Broker Operator in the Operator Hub. Continue by selecting it and clicking "Install".

* Update channel: 7.x
* Installation mode: A specific namespace on the cluster
* Installed Namespa: supermarket
* Approval strategy: Automatic

Wait for the Operator installation to complete. Open the AMQ Broker Operator management view but clicking on "View Operator" un the installation completion screen, or navigate to it via the "Installed Operators" tab in the left side-bar menu of the Administrator access.


== Seup the Supermarket Message Broker

On the AMQ Broker Operator view, select the "AMQ Broker" tab, then click "Create ActiveMQArtemis". Upon being presented with the ActiveMQArtemis configuration form, switch to the YAML view. Replace its content with the following YAML, then click "Create".

.Supermarket Broker YAML configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v2alpha4
kind: ActiveMQArtemis
metadata:
  namespace: supermarket
  name: supermarket-broker
  application: supermarket-broker
spec:
  acceptors:
    - enabledProtocols: amqp
      expose: true
      name: amqp
      port: 5672
      protocols: amqp
  adminPassword: toor
  adminUser: root
  deploymentPlan:
    size: 1
    persistenceEnabled: false
    requireLogin: false
    messageMigration: false
    managementRBACEnabled: false
    journalType: nio
    jolokiaAgentEnabled: false
    image: placeholder
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
  console:
    expose: true
----

The deployment of the broker instance can take some time. Switch to the Developer mode and navigate to the Topology view. Here you can wait for a dark blue circle to appear around the "supermarket-broker-ss" deployment.

== Setup the Broker Addresses
Switch back to the Administrator mode and navigate back to the AMQ Broker Operator view. Select the "AMQ Broker Address" tab, then click "Create ActiveMQArtemisAddress". Upon being presented with the ActiveMQArtemisAddress configuration form, switch to the YAML view. Replace its content with the following YAML, then click "Create".

.product-purchased-address YAML configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v2alpha2
kind: ActiveMQArtemisAddress
metadata:
  name: supermarket-broker-product-purchased-address
  namespace: supermarket
spec:
  addressName: productPurchasedAddress
  queueName: productPurchasedAddressQueue0
  removeFromBrokerOnDelete: true
  routingType: anycast
----

Continue by repeating this step for the following address configuration as well. 

.shelve-restock-required-address YAML configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: broker.amq.io/v2alpha2
kind: ActiveMQArtemisAddress
metadata:
  name: supermarket-broker-shelve-restock-required-address
  namespace: supermarket
spec:
  addressName: shelveRestockRequiredAddress
  queueName: shelveRestockRequiredAddressQueue0
  removeFromBrokerOnDelete: true
  routingType: anycast
----

== Check Broker Setup

Finally, we can access the brokers management web-console to see if everything is setup as expected.

Using the Administrator mode, navigate to the Routes view and locate a route with the name "supermarket-broker-wconsj-0-svc-rte".

image::amq-broker-console-route.png[AMQ Broker Console Route]

Continue by clicking on the Location (URL), which will open a website where you will click the "Management Console" link. This will open the broker management web-console. 

The console will ask you for login credentials. Use the username and password specified in the configuration YAML used when creating the broker (in step 2).

* Username: root
* Password: toor

Upon login, you will be presented with a directory tree with a root directory called "amq-broker".
Click on the second-level directory called "addresses". This will expand a list of further directories, which should include a directory for each of the addresses we configured. Clicking on any of those will show a directory "queues" containing a directory "anycast", which contains the default queue configured for this address.
